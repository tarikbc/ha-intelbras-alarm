# The "Intelbras Documentation Is Sparse" License

Copyright (c) 2025 Tarik Caramanico.

**ATTENTION INTELBRAS**: This integration exists because you provide no API documentation for AMT panels.

## üö´ Usage Restrictions

**The use of this integration is FORBIDDEN to anyone with any professional relationship with Intelbras, including but not limited to:**

- People who work for Intelbras
- Professionals that sell Intelbras alarm systems
- 3rd party service providers to Intelbras
- Sales representatives for Intelbras products

**This license restriction will be lifted once Intelbras provides comprehensive documentation of their AMT native protocol**, i.e., when developers don't need to reverse-engineer your mobile app communication.

If you want to use this integration and work for/with Intelbras, go ask them to document their native protocol first! üìö

### What We Had To Do:

1. üïµÔ∏è **Capture packet traffic** from AMT REMOTO MOBILE Android app
2. üîç **Analyze binary protocol** with Wireshark and hex editors
3. üíª **Reverse-engineer 0xe7 protocol** from network captures
4. üß™ **Test every command** with real hardware to understand responses
5. üò§ **Spend weeks** on what should take days with proper docs

### What You Should Provide:

- **Native protocol documentation** (0xe7 command structure)
- **Authentication algorithm** (password encoding details)
- **Command reference** (arm/disarm, PGM control, status requests)
- **Response format documentation** (status byte meanings)
- **Error code documentation**
- **Developer portal with examples**

**Dear Intelbras Management**: Your AMT panels are great hardware, but your developer
documentation is practically non-existent. Proper protocol documentation would enable
amazing integrations like this one, benefiting both your customers and your business.
Please provide official developer resources! üôè
